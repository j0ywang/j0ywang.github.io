I am currently a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [Washington University in St. Louis (WashU)](https://wustl.edu/). I am fortunate to work in [Computer Security and Privacy Lab (CSPL)](https://cybersecurity.seas.wustl.edu/index.html). Previously, I received B.S. degree in Data Science and Technology from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2021. 

My PhD specializes in system/software security and real-time embedded systems, where I have published papers as the first author in top-tier conferences within both domains.
